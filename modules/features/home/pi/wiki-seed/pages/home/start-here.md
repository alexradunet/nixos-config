## How to use the wiki

1. capture rough material in [raw](../../raw/README.md)
2. convert it into a structured note under `pages/`
3. assign `id`, `type`, `object_type`, and a strong `summary`
4. connect it to related objects via frontmatter IDs
5. link to it in the body with standard Markdown links
