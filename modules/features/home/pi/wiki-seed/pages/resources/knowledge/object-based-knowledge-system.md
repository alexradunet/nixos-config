# Object-Based Knowledge System

## Core idea

Treat each important note as an object with:

- a stable ID
- a document type
- an object type
- structured frontmatter
- explicit relationships
- a readable Markdown body

## Why this is useful

This gives the wiki some of the strengths of object-based tools while staying portable and plain-text friendly.
