# Build PI Wiki Object Browser Extension

## Outcome

Create a PI extension that makes the wiki easy to browse by object properties instead of only by filesystem path.

## First version scope

Keep the first version intentionally small:

- list wiki notes from the registry
- filter by `object_type`
- filter by `domain`
- filter by `status`
- filter by `areas`
- open a simple read-only note view

## Later ideas

- follow related IDs
- show backlinks
- show notes grouped by project or area
- quick jump to source note or task note
- local search over summaries and titles
